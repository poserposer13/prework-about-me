      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a training champion for W.L. Gore. I am hoping to change career paths entirely.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Flagstaff, Arizona. I have grown up all over the west coast due to my father being in the military.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy playing video games, as well as going to the gym and playing disc golf.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I honestly don't know what my dream job is at the moment because I do not know enough around what I can do with coding to know where I want to end up.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I am currently living in my hometown of Flagstaff.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I was on a certain path for a long time and that didn't work out for me, and that put me in a position, while good, not where I want to be. I have been influenced by computers my entire life so I wish to have an impact on that and follow what interests me.</p>
